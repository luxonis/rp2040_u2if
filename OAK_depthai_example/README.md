# Hand Pose Example with M8 Controller LED Trigger

This project is based on the official Luxonis hand pose example:

https://github.com/luxonis/oak-examples/tree/main/neural-networks/pose-estimation/hand-pose

It demonstrates hand detection and hand landmark estimation using DepthAI.

## Added Functionality

In addition to the original example, this version integrates an **M8 Controller Box**.

When a hand is detected:
- The LED connected to **pin 17** on the M8 controller will turn on.

This allows simple hardware feedback triggered directly from hand detection events.
